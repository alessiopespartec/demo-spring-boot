# TODO List for Publisher Management in Spring Boot Application

## Validation and Error Handling Improvements

- [ ] Implement input data validation in `PublisherController` for POST and PUT requests.
    - Check for null or empty fields in `Publisher` object.

- [ ] Add validation for valid ID formats in `PublisherController`.
    - Ensure ID is a positive number and adheres to expected format.

- [ ] Handle domain-specific business rules.
    - Include checks for unique constraints and other business-related validations.

- [ ] Ensure complete and consistent transactions in `PublisherService`.
    - Use `@Transactional` for methods that involve multiple database operations or affect multiple entities.

- [ ] Manage specific database exceptions.
    - Handle exceptions like unique constraint violations and provide appropriate responses.

- [ ] Perform thorough validation in `PublisherService` for add and update operations.
    - Validate all fields of `Publisher` for compliance with business rules.

- [x] Review and update HTTP status codes in `PublisherController`.
    - Replace `HttpStatus.FOUND` with `HttpStatus.OK` or `HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT` where appropriate.

## General Improvements

- [ ] Implement model validation using Spring's `@Valid` and `@NotNull` annotations.

- [ ] Adopt a centralized exception handling approach using `@ControllerAdvice` or `@RestControllerAdvice`.
    - Create a global exception handler to manage common errors and responses.
